RESTRICTIONS
=========================
* USB: The Power Management used by the Intel USB host must be turned off since Basler U3V devices may get
  desynchronized. If this is the case the Basler U3V devices may be not available after booting the system in some cases.
  Disable LPM packages on the USB3 bus with the following steps:
  1. Enable advanced settings by executing the following command: powercfg -attributes 2a737441-1930-4402-8d77-b2bebba308a3 d4e98f31-5ffe-4ce1-be31-1b38b384c009 -ATTRIB_HIDE
  2. Change the LPM settings in the power options:
     - Open the Power Options in the control panel.
     - Click "Change plan settings" for the selected power plan.
     - Click "Change advanced power settings".
     - In the "Power Options" dialog on the "Advanced settings" tab, select "USB settings".
     - Set "USB 3 Link Power Management" to "Off".
* pylon Viewer: If the Polling option in the Features pane is enabled while displaying
  a continuous image stream, there may be a stutter noticeable in the image stream.
  Disable polling to avoid this effect.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* SDK: Using Visual Studio 2017, you may get the MSB4211 warning. To remove the warning,
  specify the version of the Windows SDK in the Release and Debug project properties 
  (Configuration Properties -> General -> Windows SDK Version).
* SDK: The InstantCameraArray classes can acquire images from a maximum of 21 cameras.
* pylon.NET: Some VB.NET API samples fail to compile on VB.NET 2015 when using
  implicit cast operators of the API. As a workaround, the following syntax can be used:

  ' Original sample using an enum parameter
  camera.Parameters(PLCamera.TriggerSelector).GetValue()
  ' Sample using an enum parameter with workaround
  camera.Parameters(EnumName.op_Implicit(PLCamera.TriggerSelector)).GetValue()
  
* pylon.NET: If native debugging is enabled for your .NET project and if your project is 
  referencing pylon assemblies, the application may crash when running it under the Visual Studio 
  2012 or Visual Studio 2013 debugger. To avoid this issue, enable the Managed Compatibility 
  mode in the Visual Studio Debugger options.
* General: If you run the GUI applications using the built-in Administrator account on Windows 10,
  some Help/Support features may not work due to security restrictions.
* Limited Firewire (IEEE1394) support under Windows 8 and higher: The pylon drivers for IEEE1394 have 
  been tested successfully with the 64-bit versions of Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.
  However, as newer Windows versions (8 and higher) no longer explicitly support Firewire, Basler 
  may decide to discontinue Firewire support under Windows 8 and higher completely in upcoming pylon
  releases. Basler strongly recommends NOT to use Firewire as a camera interface for applications running 
  under Windows 8 or higher.
  There is no support for Firewire cameras on the 32-bit versions of Windows 8 and higher.
* AVI video recording:
    - When compression is enabled for AVI recording, some codecs may have certain restrictions
      with respect to the camera pixel format and image size. 
      Example: When selecting the Xvid codec, the use of image resolutions like 640 x 480, 1280 x 720, 
      1280 x 960, and 1280 x 1024 may not work. In that case, adjust the image height or width slightly.
    - It is recommended to use the Windows Media Player for viewing the AVI files.
    - Depending on the camera's pixel format, image size, and the codec used for compression, the 
      VLC Media Player may not play the recorded videos correctly. 
    - For rendering uncompressed video files, the VLC Media Player requires the image width to be a 
      multiple of 4.
    - The VLC Media Player may not render a video if the recording speed is less than
      5 frames per second. 
      As a workaround, navigate to the "Input Codecs" section in the VLC's "Advanced Preferences" 
      dialog and increase the value for the "File caching (ms)" setting.
* GigE Vision: The pylon performance driver will be replaced by the in-box Intel driver during an update of
  the Microsoft Windows operating system. This happens because Windows will reinstall all drivers and
  the in-box Intel driver will be regarded the best driver for Intel network adapters by the operating system.
  There are multiple ways to change this. Choose the one that suits you best.
  1. Start the setup executable again and execute the repair function of the pylon setup.
  2. In the Windows driver properties dialog of the network adapter connected to a camera,
     click the driver update button on the driver tab,
     select manual search on the computer,
     select to choose from a list of drivers installed on the computer and
     then select "Basler GigE Vision Adapter" as driver.
     Finally, click the continue button to complete.
  3. Uninstall and then reinstall pylon.
* BPD: The Basler Product Documentation requires advanced JavaScript support. Please use a modern browser, e.g., Internet Explorer 11, Edge or
     Firefox 44 (or higher).
* BPD: When opening the offline version of the Basler Product Documentation in Internet Explorer 11, the camera model filter always shows 
       the default camera, not the camera actually connected to the computer. You have to manually select your camera model to view content specific to your camera model.

RESTRICTIONS
==================

* SDK: The InstantCameraArray classes cannot acquire images from more than 21 cameras.
* pylon.NET: Some VB.NET API samples fail to compile on VB.NET 2015 when using extension methods or
  implicit cast operators of the API.
* pylon.NET: If native debugging is enabled for your .NET project and if your project is 
  referencing pylon assemblies, the application may crash when running it under the Visual Studio 
  2012 or Visual Studio 2013 debugger. To avoid this issue, enable the Managed Compatibility 
  mode in the Visual Studio Debugger options.
* pylon.NET: Writing of AVI files is currently not supported by the new pylon .NET API.
  You can work around this issue by using the AviWriter functions of the classic pylon C .NET API.
* pylon.NET: Handling of camera events is currently not supported by the new pylon .NET API.
* pylon.NET: Feature persistence (loading and saving of camera parameters from and to files)
  is currently not supported by the new pylon .NET API.
* General: If you run the GUI applications using the built-in Administrator account on Windows 10,
  some Help/Support features may not work due to security restrictions.
* GigE Vision: Multicast is currently not supported when using the socket driver.
* USB3: Currently, pylon has been tested with Renesas and Intel Ivy Bridge USB3 host controllers. pylon may 
  work with other controllers, but some functionalities may not work as expected.
* USB3: For optimum performance, install the latest driver and firmware for your USB 3.0 
  host controller.
* USB3: NEC USB 3.0 host controllers are not supported.
* USB3: The USB Configurator may crash when pressing the refresh button immediately after having attached
  or detached USB devices.
* Limited Firewire (IEEE1394) support under Windows 8 and higher: The pylon drivers for IEEE1394 have 
  been tested successfully with the 64-bit versions of Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.
  However, as newer Windows versions (8 and higher) no longer explicitly support Firewire, Basler 
  may decide to discontinue Firewire support under Windows 8 and higher completely in upcoming pylon
  releases. Basler strongly recommends NOT to use Firewire as a camera interface for applications running 
  under Windows 8 or higher.
  There is no support for Firewire cameras on the 32-bit versions of Windows 8 and higher.
* AVI video recording:
    - When compression is enabled for AVI recording, some codecs may have certain restrictions
      with respect to the camera pixel format and image size. 
      Example: When selecting the Xvid codec, the use of image resolutions like 640 x 480, 1280 x 720, 
      1280 x 960, and 1280 x 1024 may not work. In that case, slightly adjust the image height or width.
    - It is recommended to use the Windows Media Player for viewing the AVI files.
    - Depending on the camera's pixel format, image size, and the codec used for compression, the 
      VLC Media Player may not play the recorded videos correctly. 
    - For rendering uncompressed video files, the VLC Media Player requires the image width to be a 
      multiple of 4.
    - The VLC Media Player may not render a video if the recording speed is less than
      5 frames per second. 
      As a workaround, navigate to the "Input Codecs" section in the VLC's "Advanced Preferences" 
      dialog and increase the value for the "File caching (ms)" setting.

* GigE Vision: The Basler GigE performance driver supports the Intel Springville i210 series GigE network 
  adapters.
* GigE Vision: The Stream Grabber's statistic data remains readable after the grabbing has stopped.
* SDK: Added the equivalents to the GenApi::ISelector interface methods to the pylon C & .Net APIs.
* SDK: "Legacy" samples have been added illustrating how to add USB 3.0 support to applications still
  using the pylon low-level API.
* SDK: Added a feature called "migration mode" to simplify the transition of existing applications 
  to USB 3.0.
* SDK: Added documentation and sample that illustrate the Buffer Factory. The Buffer Factory enables 
  the Instant Camera classes to use memory provided by the application.
* SDK: The pylon SDK for Visual Basic 6 is no longer included.
* SDK: Visual Studio 6.0 is no longer supported by the pylon C API.
* SDK: The API for the action command feature has been reworked. C and C# samples demonstrating the 
  usage of action commands have been added.


CORRECTIONS
====================
* USB3: Fixed a bug in the device enumeration which may have caused an incomplete USB 3.0 device list.
* USB3: Implemented a solution for a bug in Intel's USB host controller driver which may cause an 
  application to block while it is stopping to grab images.
* USB3: Fixed a bug in the pylon Twain driver affecting USB cameras.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue which might cause the pylon Viewer to block in case of transmission 
  errors caused by the usage of inappropriate USB cables.
* GigE Vision: Fixed a bug which prevents devices to be enumerated when the PC is not connected to a network.
* SDK: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when device-specific event handlers were registered.
* SDK: Fixed a potential crash in the pylon Image Window.
* SDK: Improved Instant Camera chunk data support. Instant Camera objects now can deal with an image 
  stream consisting of both, frames with and frames without chunk data.


RESTRICTIONS
==================

* USB3: Currently pylon is tested with Renesas and Intel Ivy Bridge USB3 host controllers. pylon may 
  work with other controllers, but some functionalities may not work as expected.
* USB3: For optimum performance make sure to install the latest driver and firmware for your USB 3 
  host controller.
* USB3: pylon only supports USB 3 host controllers. Cameras connected to a USB 2 port will not be 
  detected/supported. You can use the USB Configurator to diagnose connection problems.
* USB3: NEC USB 3.0 host controllers are not supported.
* Limited Firewire (IEEE1394) support for Windows 8 and higher: The pylon drivers for IEEE1394 have 
  been successfully tested with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. However, as newer Windows versions (8 and
  higher) no longer explicitly support Firewire, Basler may decide to discontinue Firewire 
  support completely in upcoming pylon releases for Windows 8 and higher. We strictly recommend NOT to use 
  Firewire as camera interface for applications running with Windows 8 or higher.
* AVI video recording:
    - When compression is enabled for AVI recording, different codecs may have certain restrictions
      with respect to the camera pixel format and image size. 
      Example: When selecting the Xvid codec, the use of image resolutions like 640x480, 1280x720, 
      1280x960, and 1280x1024 might not work. In that case, slightly adjust the image height or width.
    - It is recommended to use the Windows media player for viewing the AVI files.
    - Depending on the camera's pixel format, image size, and the codec used for compression, the 
      VLC media player might not play the recorded videos correctly. 
    - For rendering uncompressed video files the VLC media player requires the image width to be a 
      multiple of 4.
    - The VLC media player might not render a video if the recording speed is less than about 
      5 frames per second. 
      As a workaround navigate to the "Input Codecs" section in the VLC's "Advanced Preferences" 
      dialog and increase the value for the "File caching (ms)" setting.
